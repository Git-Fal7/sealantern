# a 1.8 server "library" written in golang.
it says what it is. a library that allows you to run a 1.8 server in golang.
originally forked from typhooncore and ripped everything other than what 1.8 needs, grown into a super lightweight server.

# capabilities?
not that much i must say, main differences between typhooncore and this are some pvp elements implemented, better event manager, scoreboards and custom commands (along with massive memory improvements for chunks)
it is close to a limbo/lobby server rather than anything else, so you could replace some of your bukkit/spigot servers if you know some golang.
